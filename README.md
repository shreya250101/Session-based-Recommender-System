# Session-based-Recommender-System
Session-based recommendation algorithms that provide recommendations
solely based on a user’s interactions in an ongoing session, and which do
not require the existence of user profiles or their entire historical
preferences
• Your Lab evaluations vis-a-vis what you are attempting to do
Implementing the session based recommender system using graph sage
using pytorch
• Why you think this project is interesting or unique
Project is intresting because in recent years in recommender system the
user’s choice of items not only depends on long-term historical preference,
but also on short-term and more recent preferences.

# About Dataset
The YOOCHOOSE dataset contain a collection of sessions from a
retailer, where each session is encapsulating the click events that the
user performed in the session. For some of the sessions, there are
also buy events; means that the session ended with the user bought
something from the web shop. The data was collected during several
months in the year of 2014, reflecting the clicks and purchases

end users privacy, as well as the retailer, all numbers have been
modified. Do not try to reveal the identity of the retailer.
